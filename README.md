* EARTH WEB GL *

This is a simple Earth explorer, like google earth, but made specifically for tiling images squarly, any where,
specifically, the south pole areas, where google does a poor job at mapping.

This is also interactive, so you can edit/move/rotate etc.. the built in images.

There will be soon a ADD button to add your own images/urls to it, and stored
in your browser, then later who knows, maybe some online DB store.

Enjoy
